# Interactive Dashboards and Data apps with Plotly and Dash

## Harness the Power of a Fully-fledged Front End Web Framework in Python - no JavaScript Required

Learn how to build a fully customized dashboard using a real-life dataset.

In this book, we go through **The World Bank**'s **Poverty and Equity Database** to build
an interactive dashboard, that allows users to interactivley create the chart
they want and make the comparisons they want.

By the end of the book, you will have built and deployed a
[Plotly Dash app](https://povertydata.org) online, which you can play with
and see the available possibilities.

Although every chapter builds on previous chapters, each new functionality is
first built as a mini independent app, and works on its own. These can be found
in the JupyterLab notebooks in each of the respective chapters.

You also get a $100 hosting credit from Linode (to be consumed within 60 days of creating your account), so you can test it on an actual server and share it with the world.

Watch here the evolution of the [Dash app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIWU6IwWAxw) that we build, going through chapters one by one.
